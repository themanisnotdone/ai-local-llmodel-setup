# Local AI LLM Setup Guide

This repository is a practical guide for setting up and using local large language models (LLMs) on your own machine. Whether you're an SRE, Linux tinkerer, or just curious about self-hosted AI, this is designed to get you running quickly and understanding the moving parts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Run open-source LLMs (like LLaMA2, Mistral, or Gemma) locally
- Compare local vs. hosted AI tools
- Set up a lightweight development workflow using CLI or browser interfaces
- Enable further integration with LangChain or vector databases (optional)

## ðŸ§° Who is this for?

Developers, SREs, and technical users who:
- Prefer not to use cloud APIs for AI
- Want more control over models and data
- Have basic command line and Python familiarity
